# Introduction
There are different branches. Just clone the template for the branch you want with.

  git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> <remote-repo>

Currently, there are only 2 branches. 
1. Main is a basic react app with tailwind configuration. 
2. Redux - Added Redux on top of the main branch.
